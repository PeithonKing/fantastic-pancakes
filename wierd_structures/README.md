# Wierd Structures

The background canvas is randomly initialized with a 2D array of 0s and 1s. When you run the file, a noisy canvas opens up, and you can see a line shaped structure moving over it (used perlin noise).

You can pause the animation by pressing the space bar and resume by pressing it again.

But once you pause the animation, you will see there is no line structure anymore. It's just a random noise.

Again when you resume the animation, the line structure is back.

I swear I do not do anything to the canvas when you pause the animation.
