# Fantastic Pancakes


This is a collection of little physics toys, math experiments, and interactive simulations I build in my free time, mostly to learn the math behind them and to have fun exploring how things work. My main goal is to understand the underlying mathematics, and to make the results easy to share and play with. That’s why, going forward, I use p5.js for all new projects: it’s perfect for browser-based demos and makes it easy for anyone to try things out instantly. Some of the older projects have Python versions (usually with Pygame or NumPy/Matplotlib), since I hadn’t discovered p5.js back then. If you like math, tinkering, or just want to see some neat visualizations, you might enjoy poking around!
